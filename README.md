# Using testthat and shinytest with Shiny

- [X] Create test folder containing tests
  - How should this be structured? Does each test belong in its own file? Do you create families of tests in their own files? Once organized, how do you "run all tests"?
- Running a test that doesn't error follows the silence is golden rule. Is there a way to print the test name and "passed" for the tests that do run?
- Ideally I'd like all tests to be run when I deploy to RSC. What does that workflow look like?
